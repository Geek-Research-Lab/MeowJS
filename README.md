<br>
This is a full-packaged repository. <br>
Main file --- meow.js <br>
<i>To view the repository in separate branches:-</i><br>
1. <a href="https://github.com/Geek-Research-Lab/MeowJS/tree/MeowNinjaJS">MeowNinja</a> (repository dedicated for cool JS focussing math, prediction, text, images, audio, video)<br>
2. <a href="https://github.com/Geek-Research-Lab/MeowJS/tree/MeowMathJS">MeowMath</a> (updates MeowJS & MeowNinjaJS too, but the repository is dedicated purely only for math) <br>
Created branches only to split tasks and then, merge them, which is crazy. <br>
A common <a href="https://github.com/Geek-Research-Lab/MeowJS/wiki">wiki</a> is also provided. <br>
This is a <a href="http://geekresearchlab.net/mtechproject/">project</a> done by an individual. <br>
Contributions are welcome. <br>
