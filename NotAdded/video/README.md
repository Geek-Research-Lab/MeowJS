<b>About:</b><br>
A WebRTC peer-to-peer mechanism that makes easy transferring/receiving of any files (text or image or audio or video). <br>
<br>Currently, it can only work with Chrome... [In-development] <br>
It will not work in Firefox (though it's functionalities are added). <br>
But, it will 100% never works in IE... [sad] <br>
<br>
<b>Advantages:-</b> <br>
Fast uploading speed that can be made possible that can be shared in 'private' from peer-to-peer through a link. <br>
Download speed is faster, due to WebRTC blah blah. <br>
<br>
<b>Status:- </b>Failed (the work will be continued later)<br>
<br>
Code sharing:- Anybody can use these codes. I mostly extracted from existing ones and customized it. These codes have no errors. Make sure to remove comments lines where i smartly hidden few codes lol. Gain more ideas by entering into <a href="https://github.com/stars">my starred repos</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Geek-Research-Lab/MeowJS/wiki/Crazy-Gists">resources</a>. I mostly followed these stuffs.
<br>As for me, I'm literally broken because i put most of my efforts into this for a week. Or maybe, i need more experience. Actually, it could be or may be easily possible (not saying it's really easy) through google cloud appspot, there is a <a href="https://apprtc.appspot.com/">small demo</a> that runs only in chrome. But, i tried the hard way having the idea to run without any support in web. The beautiful part of WebRTC is that it's fast and it can be coupled with anything, because it's definition itself says it. I'd this crazy thing running through me which is....... blah blah blah!
