Here are the tests for WebRTC (currently for audio)
<br>
After cloning or downloading this repo, then run this test_rtc.html in IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari. 
<br>
Feel the difference.
<br>
P.S.: It works in all browsers. And mp3 files not added here, so edit it in <code>test_rtc.html</code> before running it.
<br>
<br>
I'll be separately loading these stuffs in a <a href="https://github.com/ashumeow/MeowAudioStream">new repo</a> sooner.
