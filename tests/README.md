Here are the tests for WebRTC (currently for audio)
<br>
After cloning or downloading this repo, then run this test_rtc.html in IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari. 
<br>
Feel the difference.
<br>
Currently, js/MeowWebRTC_audio.js works well... js/MeowWebRTC_stream.js will work well if it's linked well (on dynamic mode). <br>
We can't analyze streaming performance results in static mode. lol. Needs some more skills! <br>
<br>
static => offline <br>
dynamic => online
